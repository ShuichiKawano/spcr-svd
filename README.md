# Sparse principal component regression via singular value decomposition approach. 
This is an R source code for performing sparse principal component regression via singular value decomposition approach (spcrSVD). The directory **R** includes four files as follows. 
- **spcrSVD.R** provides spcrSVD via an ADMM algorithm. 
- **cv.spcrSVD.R** computes cross-validation of spcrSVD. 
- **spcrSVD_linearized.R** provides spcrSVD via a linearized ADMM algorithm. 
- **cv.spcrSVD_linearized.R** computes cross-validation of spcrSVD_linearized.
